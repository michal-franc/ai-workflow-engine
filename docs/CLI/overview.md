## Scope

The CLI system covers `issue-cli`, the command-line tool agents use to interact with issues during automated workflows.

## Key Files

- `cmd/issue-cli/main.go` — entry point, global-flag parsing, top-level error printing
- `cmd/issue-cli/commands.go` — registry (`registerCommand`, `lookupCommand`, `printHelp`); top-level help is auto-generated from this list
- `cmd/issue-cli/context.go` — `Command` and `Context` types, `findIssueOrErr`, `requireSlug`, `newFlagSet`, `flagWasSet`
- `cmd/issue-cli/helpers.go` — shared helpers (`loadProjectOrErr` → `resolveBootstrap` / `resolveFromConfig`, `formatProjectList`, `parseFieldFlags`, `normalizeEscapedText`, `writeJSON`, `printCheckboxes`, etc.)
- `cmd/issue-cli/cmd_<name>.go` — one file per subcommand. Each file declares a `*Command`, registers it in `init()`, and owns its own `flag.FlagSet`. Group commands (`data`, `workflow`, `process`) dispatch internally to per-subcommand handlers in the same file.
- `cmd/issue-cli/workflow_init.go` — testable `doWorkflowInit` core (the `workflow init` subcommand wraps it from `cmd_workflow.go`)

### Adding a new subcommand

1. Create `cmd/issue-cli/cmd_<name>.go`.
2. Declare a `var <name>Command = &Command{Name, ShortHelp, LongHelp, Run}` and call `registerCommand(<name>Command)` in `init()`.
3. Build the `Run` function as `func(ctx *Context, args []string) error`. Construct a `flag.FlagSet` via `newFlagSet("<name>", ctx)` and parse `args` (which is everything after the subcommand name). Return errors instead of calling `os.Exit`.
4. Reach the project via `ctx.Project`, write to `ctx.Stdout` / `ctx.Stderr`, and consult `ctx.JSONOutput` for output mode. The package-global `jsonOutput` no longer exists.
5. The new command appears in `issue-cli help` automatically.

### `append`

`issue-cli append <slug> --body "..."` adds content to the issue body. Two routing modes:

- **Default** — content is appended after the existing body. Headings inside `--body` must be unique against the issue.
- **Section** — pass `--section "Name"` to append into an existing section (or create it if missing). Use `--force` to disambiguate when the same heading exists at multiple levels.

If `--body` starts with a heading that is already present in the issue (and the rest contains only deeper subheadings), the command auto-routes into that section — equivalent to passing `--section`. This means agents drafting `## Implementation\n…` style appends do not have to retry with `--section` after a duplicate-heading failure.

The duplicate-heading guard still fires when `--body` introduces a *peer* heading that collides (e.g., `--body "## New\n…\n## Existing"`); pass `--section` to disambiguate.

### `list`

`issue-cli list` filters by `--status`, `--system`, `--assignee`, `--version`. With `--json`, each entry is the full issue plus two scoring fields:

| Field            | Type                                | When populated                                                                                  |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Score`          | `float` (or `null`)                 | `workflow.yaml` has `scoring.enabled: true` and the issue contributes to at least one component |
| `ScoreBreakdown` | `{Total, Components[]}` (or `null`) | Same as above. `Components` is an ordered list of `{Name, Points, Detail}` entries              |

Both fields are `null` when scoring is disabled or the issue has no scoring inputs (no priority, no `due`, no `created`, no scored labels, no `score_boost`). The breakdown matches what the web viewer renders into the `⚡N` badge — same `tracker.ComputeScore` is the single source of truth.

`--sort score` orders the output by `Score` descending. When scoring is enabled and `default_sort: score_desc` is set in `workflow.yaml`, the sort is applied automatically with no flag.

```bash
issue-cli list --json | jq '.[] | select(.Score != null) | {Slug, Score}'
issue-cli list --sort score --status open
```

### `transition`

`issue-cli transition <slug> --to "<status>"` runs the workflow engine — same path the board uses for drag-and-drop, so behavior matches.

When a transition declares `fields[]` with `required: true`, supply answers in either of two ways:

```bash
# Inline: repeatable --field key=value
issue-cli transition <slug> --to "waiting-for-team-input" --field waiting="design review"

# Or set the frontmatter ahead of time; the validator reads it at transition time
issue-cli set-meta <slug> --key waiting --value "design review"
issue-cli transition <slug> --to "waiting-for-team-input"
```

`--field` only applies to the in-flight transition. `set-meta` persists the value, so subsequent transitions and views see it. Section-targeted fields (`target: section:<Title>`) ignore frontmatter and always need a fresh `--field` answer because they append a new line to the body each time.

### `process transitions`

Rules are rendered from the loaded workflow rather than a hardcoded list. Each
row lists the validation rules, human-approval gates, and side effects
(`set_fields`, `append_section`, `inject_prompt`) attached to the transition;
optional and global statuses are surfaced separately.

Three scopes are supported. Without arguments the default project workflow is
printed and a hint at the bottom names any per-system overlays and points at
the scoping flags. Passing `--system <name>` (alias `--workflow <name>`)
prints the rules merged with that system's overlay. Passing an issue slug
resolves the issue's `system` field and prints the scoped rules; issues with
no system explicitly say `(no system overlay; project default)` so agents do
not mistake the default output for an issue-specific one.

The renderer is backed by `tracker.DescribeAction` and
`tracker.ValidationSummary` so descriptions stay in sync with the same strings
shown in transition previews.

### `data`

`issue-cli data <sub> <slug>` reads and writes the per-issue structured data store (`<slug>.data.json` next to the issue's markdown file). Subcommands are `add`, `list`, `set-status`, `set-tier`, `set-comment`, `remove`. Agents must use the CLI rather than touching the JSON file directly so the on-disk shape can change without breaking them. Full reference: [Per-issue Data Store](../data-store.md).

```bash
id=$(issue-cli data add <slug> --description "finding" --tier "🔴 critical")
issue-cli data set-status  <slug> "$id" "🔥 must-fix"
issue-cli data set-tier    <slug> "$id" "🟢 nice"        # pass "" to clear
issue-cli data set-comment <slug> "$id" --text "see processor_test.go:142"
issue-cli data list <slug> --json
```

`--tier` and `set-tier` validate against the body's `<!-- data tiers=... -->` enum when present; without a tiers marker the workflow opts out of validation and any value is accepted.

`add` prints the assigned id on stdout (and a human line on stderr) so it composes in shell pipelines. `--json` on `list` emits the entries array exactly.

### `workflow init`

`issue-cli workflow init` bootstraps a fresh project directory. It writes `workflow.yaml` from one of three bundled templates and scaffolds `issues/` and `docs/` if they do not already exist.

```bash
issue-cli workflow init --template development
issue-cli workflow init --template review --force
issue-cli workflow init                          # interactive prompt
```

Templates:

| Name          | Status set                                                                  | Use case                                  |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| `development` | `idea → in design → backlog → in progress → testing → human-testing → documentation → shipping → done` | Software delivery flow (mirrors this repo) |
| `review`      | `inbox → triaged → reviewing → needs-changes → approved → archived`         | Review and triage of incoming items       |
| `writing`     | `idea → outline → drafting → editing → review → published`                  | Long-form content                         |

Behaviour:

- `--template <name>` selects a template. Without it, the command shows a numbered prompt when stdin is a terminal; piped or scripted invocations must pass the flag and exit non-zero with the list of valid templates if they don't.
- `--force` overwrites an existing `workflow.yaml`. Without it, the command refuses to touch the existing file and exits non-zero.
- `issues/` and `docs/` creation is idempotent — running the command in an already-initialised project does not error and does not re-create directories.
- Templates live as plain YAML under `cmd/issue-cli/templates/workflow/*.yaml` and are embedded at build time via `//go:embed`. The list of valid `--template` names is derived from the embedded directory, so adding a new template is just dropping a new `<name>.yaml` file there and rebuilding.

### `projects` and multi-project resolution

`issue-cli projects` lists every project parsed from `projects.yaml`. The active project (resolved via `--project` or the single-project default) is marked `(active)`; in a multi-project setup with no `--project` the historical fallback (`projects[0]`) is marked `(historical default)`. `--json` emits an array with `slug`, `name`, `issue_dir`, `active`, and `default` fields.

```bash
issue-cli projects
issue-cli projects --json
issue-cli --project cli projects   # marks "cli" as active
```

`projects` is intentionally tolerant of a missing or unreadable config file — it is the discovery surface a confused bot reaches for first, so it must succeed when nothing else does. `help` and `process` are in the same allow-list.

**Resolution order in `loadProjectOrErr`:**

1. **Explicit `--project <slug>` always wins.** A bot inside one project workdir (with its own `./issues/`) can still query a sibling project by passing `--project`. The bootstrap auto-detection on cwd yields to an explicit flag.
2. **No `--project` + a local `./issues/`** → bootstrap mode synthesizes a single project from cwd. `--project` is unused; `len(allProjects) == 1`.
3. **No `--project` + no local `./issues/`** → consult `projects.yaml`. With `>1` project this returns `errAmbiguousProject` (exit non-zero) and lists configured slugs so the bot retries with the right `--project`. Single-project setups silently use `projects[0]` — byte-identical to pre-multiproject behaviour.

**Error message contract.** When an issue isn't found in a multi-project setup, the error appends `Searched project: <slug>` and an `Available projects:` enumeration with a `Retry with: issue-cli --project <slug> ...` hint. Single-project setups keep the historical `issue not found: <slug>\n\nRun: issue-cli list` message verbatim — this is the regression guard for bots that already grep for it.

**Help output.** With `>1` project configured, `issue-cli` (no args) and `issue-cli help` print a `Configured projects:` block enumerating slugs with `(active)` / `(historical default)` markers. Single-project setups omit the block.

**Dispatched agent prompts.** When the web app dispatches a bot via `buildAgentPrompt`, every `issue-cli ` invocation in the prompt body is rewritten to `issue-cli --project <slug>` so the bot doesn't have to discover the project. In bootstrap mode (`proj == nil` or empty slug) no rewrite happens — there is nothing to inject.

### `process schema` and `process changes`

`process schema` is driven off reflection on the YAML struct tags defined
in `internal/tracker/workflow_config.go`. Every `yaml:"..."` field must
also carry a `desc:"..."` tag — the tracker tests fail otherwise, so the
schema output cannot drift from the parser. Action types and validation
rules are documented via explicit registries (`WorkflowActionTypes`,
`WorkflowValidationRules` in `internal/tracker/workflow_schema.go`) kept
next to the switch statements that handle them.

`process changes` embeds `cmd/issue-cli/CHANGELOG.md` at build time via
`//go:embed` and prints it newest-first, capped to the 20 most recent `## v`
entries. The CHANGELOG lives under `cmd/issue-cli/` (not the project root)
because Go's `//go:embed` cannot reference files outside the embedding
package's directory. When cutting a release, add a new `## vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD`
section to the top of that file; the annotated tag message should mirror the
bullet list.

## Design Considerations

When working on CLI changes:

- Output is consumed by agents, not humans — prioritize machine comprehension over aesthetics
- Document the output contract early: whether text is human-facing or agent-facing
- Consider whether `--json` or other machine-readable output is needed
- Script compatibility matters — avoid breaking existing agent prompts that parse CLI output
- After making changes, run `make install` to update the binary
