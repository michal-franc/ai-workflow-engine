## Scope

The UI system covers HTML templates, CSS styling, and client-side JavaScript for all web views.

## Key Files

- `templates/list.html` — filterable issue list
- `templates/board.html` — kanban board with drag-and-drop
- `templates/detail.html` — issue detail with sidebar, comments, dispatch
- `templates/graph.html` — workflow status graph
- `templates/docs.html` — documentation viewer with sidebar navigation
- `templates/_create_modal.html` — shared "New issue" modal partial included by list and board
- `templates/_project_actions.html` — shared project-level custom action bar + dispatch modal, included by list, board, and graph
- `static/style.css` — all CSS (dark GitHub theme)

## Design Considerations

When working on UI changes:

- Templates use Go's `html/template` — changes require a server restart (assets are embedded)
- For work that launches local tools or editors, decide whether to reuse existing tmux/alacritty patterns
- Handlers must not block on local processes — use goroutines for async operations
- User feedback after actions (dispatch, approve, save) goes through the toast notification system
- Board card fields and columns are driven by `workflow.yaml` — see [Board Configuration](../board-configuration)
- The detail view substitutes `<!-- data -->` markers in the rendered body with an inline data table (status dropdown + contenteditable comment + remove button). Markdown HTML comments require `goldmark/renderer/html.WithUnsafe()`, which is enabled in `internal/tracker/issue.go`. See [Per-issue Data Store](../data-store.md).

## Mockups in design

UI issues get mockups before the written design. The UI overlay in `workflow.yaml` adds a `## Mockups` section when an issue enters `in design`, and its boxes must be ticked before `backlog`.

1. Build the mockups as a Claude artifact: a Design canvas with one artboard per screen, or an HTML page for a single view or a comparison of options. Use real project data.
2. Link the artifact in frontmatter with `issue-cli set-meta <slug> --key mockups --value <url>`. It renders as a link in the detail sidebar.
3. Artifacts are private, so save the sources under `issues/attachments/<issue-name>/`.
4. Make screenshots with `tools/mockup-shots/shots.py issues/attachments/<issue-name>/` (Python Playwright with Chromium). It writes `<screen>.png` next to each source:
   - **Design artboards** (`*.dc.html`) need the claude.ai runtime, so they render through a small offline shim (`tools/mockup-shots/dc-shim.js`) covering `{{holes}}`, `<sc-for>`, `<sc-if>` and `renderVals()`. Each screen shows its initial state; event handlers are ignored.
   - **HTML pages** saved from an artifact have no `<!doctype>` or `<head>` (claude.ai adds them at publish time); the script adds them so the page doesn't render in quirks mode.
   - Captures are full height, wait for web fonts, and pin the colour scheme (`--scheme dark|light`, default dark). A page with a box that scrolls sideways (a board) is widened until nothing is cut off; `--width` sets the width yourself.
   - `--shot "<css>=<name>"` (repeatable) adds a close-up of one element as `<name>.png`; `--selector "<css>"` shoots every match as `<screen>-<n>.png`. Sticky and fixed bars are pinned in place for these so they don't cover the shot.
5. Under `## Mockups`, add one subsection per screen with its image (path relative to the issue file) and a description of the layout, regions, states and interactions, detailed enough to build from without opening the artifact.

Issues with no visible change write why under `## Mockups` and tick the boxes.

Images saved on an agent's worktree branch don't show on the board until that branch is merged, because the viewer reads `issues/attachments/` from the main checkout. Example: `ui/workbench-redesign-inbox-system-pages-balance-board-and-decisions-index`.

## Detail Sidebar Toggles

The frontmatter sidebar on `/issue/<slug>` has a small toolbar at the top with two toggles:

- **Lock** — pins the sidebar with `position: sticky` so it stays visible while the body scrolls. Default: on. When the sidebar is taller than the viewport, it scrolls internally.
- **Hide** — collapses the sidebar; the body expands to full width. A "Show sidebar" button appears in the body toolbar to bring it back.

Both states persist independently in `localStorage` (`sidebar-locked`, `sidebar-hidden`). An early-load script in `<head>` reads them and sets `data-sidebar-locked` / `data-sidebar-hidden` on `<html>` before paint to avoid a flash. CSS targets `html[data-sidebar-locked="true"] .detail-sidebar` and `html[data-sidebar-hidden="true"] .detail-layout`.

Lock defaults to on (the early-load check is `localStorage.getItem('sidebar-locked') !== 'false'`), so an explicit user opt-out is required to keep the sidebar scrolling with the body.

## Create issue modal

Both `list.html` and `board.html` show a **+ New issue** button in the header (next to the theme picker) that opens a shared modal defined in `templates/_create_modal.html`. The modal posts to `POST /p/<project>/issues/create` (handler `handleCreateIssue` in `handlers_issue_mutate.go`) and on `201` navigates the browser to the new issue's detail page.

Form fields:

- **Title** (required, autofocused)
- **Body** (required, markdown). Prefilled from the per-status body template defined in `workflow.yaml`; if the user has not edited the body, changing the Status dropdown refills it from the new status's template. A `bodyDirty` flag in the partial gates the refill.
- **System** (required). Prefilled from the currently-active `?system=` filter on the page; falls back to "No system" if no filter is set.
- **Status** (default = first status before `backlog`, e.g. `idea`). The select is populated from the workflow's "creatable" set — every status with index < `backlog` — computed by `createOptions(wf)` in `handlers_list.go`.
- **Priority** (optional: low/medium/high/critical)
- **Labels** (optional, comma-separated)

The board's per-column `+` buttons keep working and pass their column status as a preset to `openCreateModal(status)`; the header button calls `openCreateModal('')` for the default.

Server-side wiring: both `ListData` and `BoardData` carry `CreatableStatuses []string` and `BodyTemplates map[string]string`. The templates JSON is embedded into the page via the `toJSON` template helper (`template_funcs.go`) which returns `template.JS` to bypass HTML escaping.

Auto-refresh interaction: `static/auto-refresh.js` skips its full-page `location.reload()` (board "needs reload" path and the detail-view path) when `window.__createModalOpen` is true, so a polled refresh cannot wipe an in-flight create.

## Project action bar

The list, board, and graph views show an **Actions** bar below the header (rendered by `templates/_project_actions.html`, included via `{{template "project-actions-bar" .}}`) when the workflow defines `project_actions:`. Each button POSTs to `POST /p/<project>/action/<id>` (handler `handleProjectAction` in `handlers_dispatch.go`), which dispatches a one-shot agent with no issue context — prompts template with `{{project}}` only. The shared dispatch result modal is defined in the same partial (`project-actions-modal`). This mirrors the per-issue custom action buttons on `detail.html`, which come from `issue_actions:` (legacy alias: `actions:`). `ListData`, `BoardData`, and `GraphData` each carry `ProjectActions []tracker.CustomAction`.
